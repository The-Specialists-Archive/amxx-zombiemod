SERVER RULES:
  
    * Do not hack or use exploits in the Half Life Engine.
    * Do not spam the server with text or a microphone.
    * Be respectful towards other players.
    * Racist attitudes and other bigotry will not be tolerated.
    * You may recover HP or reload in an area of safety. However, camping or attacking zombies in these areas is against the rules. This includes any area where a zombie can not naturally get to, such as the rooftops on Mecklenburg or behind the fence on TS_Bikini.


Warning: Failure to abide by these rules will result in a ban.

This mod is made by StevenlAFl and is in no way related to Harbu.

This mod is also the same one on "Zombie DM - Steve.finalseconds.com"
and thus you have the same levels on all "Zombie DM" named servers.
